# Before medically advised (BMA) discharge and drug overdose_cohort study

<p> All codes are from the cohort study</p>
<p>Uses data from BC Provincial Overdose Cohort (ODC)</p>
<p>The team at Staples Lab work collaboratively to develop code under the supervision of Dr JA Staples.</p>
<p>Most codes were adapted from initial code written by S Erdelyi and/or JA Staples for other projects, which were then adapted 
and modified by D Daly-Grafstein, Y Yu, M Khan and X Hu for various different studies. Updated versions of codes
are then used in subsequent projects by all Staples Lab members.</p>
<p>The primary data analyst for the AMA-OD_cohort study was Xiao (Nicole) Hu.</p>
